"The clustering strategy is based on sharing information between cluster "
"nodes about online users. Who is online and where the user is connected. "
"Communication between cluster nodes is processed with the highest "
"priority to ensure minimal delays with online user data population. An "
"efficient synchronization mechanism allows for a minimal traffic between "
"cluster nodes and distributing accurate data about connecting and "
"disconnecting users."
